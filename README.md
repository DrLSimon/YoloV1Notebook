# YoloV1 in Pytorch

This repository is a guided implementation of YoloV1 from scratch. It is
inspired by (and borrows material from) [Aladdin Persson Youtube video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=n9_XyCGr-MI).
The implementation steps are exposed as a set of exercises, presented and exposed in the [jupyter notebook](./Yolo.ipynb).
